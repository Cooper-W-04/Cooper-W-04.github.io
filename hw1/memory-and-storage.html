            Computer memory and storage are essential components used to store data and instructions.
            Memory, commonly referred to as RAM (Random Access Memory), temporarily holds data that
            the CPU needs to access quickly while programs are running. Storage devices, such as
            hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs), are used for long-term data
            retention, even when the computer is powered off. Together, memory and storage enable
            efficient data access, system performance, and information preservation.
