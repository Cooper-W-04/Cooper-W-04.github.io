            Networking hardware consists of physical devices that allow computers and other systems
            to communicate with each other. Common networking components include network interface
            cards (NICs), routers, switches, and access points. These devices manage data transmission,
            control traffic flow, and enable secure connections across local and wide area networks.
            Networking hardware plays a critical role in connectivity, performance, and cybersecurity.
