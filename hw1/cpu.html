            A central processing unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that performs
            most of the processing tasks. It is responsible for executing instructions from
            software programs by performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output
            operations. Often referred to as the “brain” of the computer, the CPU interprets and
            processes data, coordinating the actions of other hardware components.
            Modern CPUs typically contain multiple cores, allowing them to handle several tasks
            simultaneously and improve overall system performance.
